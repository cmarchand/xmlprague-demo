## Using Maven with XML development projects
[TOC](toc.md)

### Resume

Going with Maven and XML did not looks like an easy way to go but we finlaly found a solution that fullfill our requirements.

The good news os that the plugins we develop are quite stable and open source.
Anyone willing to use them (or just one of them) is free to do it. He does't has to know a single line of java: as any maven plugin it works like a black box which you only have to configured to your need.

This talk is an occasion to propose to the XML folk "Hey join this way to do"

In this way, if anybody needs the last skeleton implement he just have to call it in his pom.xml :)

Other example of common dev : 
- Docbook XSLT
- Dita tookkit
- W3C xml-to-json.xsl
- etc.

The only requirement to pubslih on maven central is to have domain name.
